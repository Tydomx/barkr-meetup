 ## Description

For our group project, we built a social network for dog owners as our interactive full stack web application. Our app is still under development with some a few more features including a search bar in the navigation, a discover sidebar with the top dog owner users and edit profile functionality.

We built Barkr with the following:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) 
* [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Express - Sessions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session)
* [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
